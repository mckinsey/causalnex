## Thanks for supporting contributions

CausalNex was originally designed by [Paul Beaumont](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbeaumont/) and
[Ben Horsburgh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhorsburgh/) to solve challenges they faced in
inferring causality in their project work.

CausalNex would also not be possible without the generous sharing from leading researches in the field of causal inference
and we are grateful to everyone who advised and supported us, filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and answered
questions or simply be part of inspiring discussions.
