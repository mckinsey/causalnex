# Installation prerequisites

CausalNex supports macOS, Linux and Windows (7 / 8 / 10 and Windows Server 2016+). If you encounter any problems on
these platforms, please check the FAQ, and / or the Alchemy community support on Slack.

CausalNex requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to be installed.

## macOS / Linux

In order to work effectively with CausalNex projects, we highly recommend you download and install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) (Python 3.x version).

## Windows

You will require admin rights to complete the installation of the following tools on your machine:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows) (Python 3.x version)

## Python virtual environments

Python's virtual environments can be used to isolate the dependencies of different individual projects,
avoiding Python version conflicts. They also prevent permission issues for non-administrator users.
For more information, please refer to this
[guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Using `conda`

We recommend creating your virtual environment using [`conda`](https://conda.io/docs/), a package and environment
manager program bundled with Anaconda.

#### Create an environment with `conda`

Use [`conda create`](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#id1) to create a python 3.6
environment called `environment_name` by running:

```bash
conda create --name environment_name python=3.6
```

#### Activate an environment with `conda`

Use [`conda activate`](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)
to activate an environment called `environment_name` by running:

```bash
conda activate environment_name
```

When you want to deactivate the environment you are using with CausalNex, you can use
[`conda deactivate`](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#id6):

```bash
conda deactivate
```

#### Other `conda` commands

To list all existing `conda` environments:

```bash
conda env list
```

To delete an environment:

```bash
conda remove --name environment_name --all
```

### Alternatives to `conda`

If you prefer an alternative environment manager such as [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), etc, please read their respective documentation.
